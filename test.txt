A 70 year-old generally healthy woman presented with discomfort and decreased vision in her only good-seeing right eye. She had had extracapsular cataract extraction with PCIOL 12 years previously. In this right eye visual acuity was 20/150, IOP was 34 mmHg. The external eye was quiet, cornea dystrophic but without edema. . The anterior chamber was uniformly shallow. There was a sector iridectomy superiorly. Angle details could not be visualized even with forceful corneal compression with the gonioscope. There was no vitreous or choroidal pathology. The disc had 0.7 cupping. Initial treatment with pilocarpine resulted in elevation of IOP and was immediately discontinued. Subsequent IOP-lowering medications were only mildly effective. Addition of cycloplegia resulted in chamber deepening from 2.2 mm to 2.5 mm and IOP decrease to 19 mmHg. UBM and US did not reveal any significant pathology other than Elsching pearls in the capsular bag. Attempt at discontinuing cycloplegia resulted in immediate reversal of treatment effect and so it was continued. After a week IOP elevated again, and with the diagnosis of aqueous misdirection the patient was treated with pars-plana vitrectomy, hyaloidectomy and zonulectomy. During a follow-up of 4 months untreated IOP has been 10 mmHg, the chamber deep and the angle open. This case represents a most unique example of "malignant glaucoma", not after recent surgery. The differential diagnosis according to the Ritch mechanistic classification of angle-closure is nicely demonstrated, with the necessary conclusion that indeed a posterior-segment source was responsible for the angle closure and chamber shallowing. The diagnosis had to be firmly established since the consequent treatment was unusual surgery in an only seeing eye. I am aware of only one report in the literature of a similar case.
